# Risk-Assessment-for-Life-Insurance
The main objective here is assessing risk of the people applying for a Life Insurance. Built a model that categorized the people into one of the eight classes by their personal demographics, insurance history and employment history. From the allotted class, we assessed risk of that customer. The dataset is taken from Kaggle.
